## Default

- ARROW KEYS: Move (if possible) to the cell in the direction specified.
- SPACEBAR: Move to the next cell in the focused clue, if one exists.
- BACKSPACE: Move to the previous cell in the focused clue, if one exists.
- TAB: Move to the first cell of the next clue, 'wrapping' to the first clue.
  - SHIFT-TAB reverses the direction
- A-Z: Enter the character and advance to next character in clue. Not locale aware!
- ENTER: Switch between across and down.

### Problems

- Clue list cannot be selected via the keyboard.
- No keyboard navigation within the clue list.
- Arrow key movement is bounded to current clue - by design? Tab used to navigate _between_ clues. Change of direction/clue is possible at crossing clue intersection.
